What is demonreach?
------------------------
demonreach is an IRC bot in Perl that collects statistics for IRC networks and outputs it in easy to view formats. 

Why the name?
------------------------
Demonreach is a being with Intellectus from the Dresden Files. As I quote from [wikia](http://dresdenfiles.wikia.com/wiki/Intellectus):

>The term Intellectus is used when a supreme immortal being is able to gain access to any knowledge needed. It is a mode of existence that for a few rare beings, allows them to view reality as one piece, place and moment. They no longer search for knowledge, they just simply know. They see the 'whole picture'.
